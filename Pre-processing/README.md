## About

Pre-process simulation output files by extracting systemic arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure, converting 
those signals to their frequency-domain representation and storing `X.mat` and `Y.mat` files. 

One should not run any script in this folder, `script_pipeline.py` does it for you.
