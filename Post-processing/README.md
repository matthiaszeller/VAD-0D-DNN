## About

Compute hemodynamic quantities (e.g. left ventricular ejection fraction) and their errors on the test set.

## Prerequisites

You should have run `pipeline/script_pipeline.py` and `pipeline/script_test_dnn.py` so that you have selected a neural 
network architecture and generated simulation data on the test set based on 0D-model parameters predicted by the DNN.
