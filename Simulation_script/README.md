## About

Run simulations of the zero-dimensional (0D) model of the cardiovascular system written in Modelica language.

* Perform sensitivity analysis with `script_sensitivity_analysis.py`
  
* Study physiology of the model for a set of heart failures (severe and medium heart failure, healthy heart) and several 
pump configuration (with and without artificial pulse, pump rotational speed) with `script_case_study.py`
  
* Utility functions that glue Python with Openmodelica environment are gathered in `utils_openmodelica.py`
